### Planning and system installation
<br>
1.1.1  
Identify the context for which a new system is planned. (AO: 2)  
The extent and limitations of a new system should be appreciated.  
Organizational issues related to the installation of new systems such as user roles, underlying technologies.

1.1.2  
Describe the need for change management. (AO: 2)  
Students should understand there are a number of factors that need to be managed to ensure change is successful.  
S/E The way that change is managed can have significant effects on employers and employees.

1.1.3  
Outline compatibility issues resulting from situations including legacy systems or business mergers. (AO: 2)  
INT, S/E When organizations interact, particularly on an international basis, there may be issues of software compatibility and language differences.

1.1.4  
Compare the implementation of systems using a clientâ€™s hardware with hosting systems remotely. (AO: 3)  
The benefits and drawbacks of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) should be considered.  
S/E, INT, AIM 8 The remote host may be in a different time zone and this can have significant effects on end-users.

1.1.5  
Evaluate alternative installation processes. (AO: 3)  
Students should be aware of the methods of implementation/ conversion.  
Parallel running, pilot running, direct changeover and phased conversion.  
S/E Training issues may require organizations to restructure their workforce.

1.1.6  
Discuss problems that may arise as a part of data migration. (AO: 3)  
INT These include incompatible file formats, data structures, validation rules, incomplete data transfer and international conventions on dates, currencies and character sets.

1.1.7  
Suggest various types of testing. (AO: 3)  
The crucial importance of testing at all stages of implementation should be emphasized, with the stages clearly defined.  
Types of testing can include: user acceptance testing, debugging, beta testing.  
Students should be aware that there are programs that can test other programs, thereby automating parts of the testing process and reducing costs.  
S/E Inadequate testing can reduce employee productivity and lead to end-user dissatisfaction.

### User focus
<br>
1.1.8  
Describe the importance of user documentation. (AO: 2)  
S/E The quality of user documentation can affect the rate of implementation of the new system.

1.1.9  
Evaluate different methods of providing user documentation. (AO: 3)  
Examples should include methods such as: help files, online support and printed manuals.  
S/E The quality of user documentation can affect the rate of implementation of the new system.  

1.1.10  
Evaluate different methods of delivering user training. (AO: 3)  
Examples should include self- instruction, formal classes, remote/ online training.  
S/E The quality of the delivery of user training can affect the rate of implementation of the new system.

### System backup
<br>
1.1.11  
Identify a range of causes of data loss. (AO: 2)  
Causes include malicious activities and natural disasters.  
S/E Malicious activity may be a result of activities by employees within the organization or intruders.

1.1.12  
Outline the consequences of data loss in a specified situation. (AO: 2)  
S/E Loss of medical records, cancellation of a hotel reservation without the knowledge of the traveller.

1.1.13  
Describe a range of methods that can be used to prevent data loss. (AO: 2)  
These should include failover systems, redundancy, removable media, offsite/online storage.

### Software deployment
<br>
1.1.14

Describe strategies for managing releases and updates. (AO: 2)  
Students should be aware of a variety of ways in which updates and patches are made available and deployed. This includes automatic updates received on a regular basis online.  
S/E, INT Performance issues related to the inability to install updates may hinder end-users and reduce compatibility between systems in geographically diverse locations.
