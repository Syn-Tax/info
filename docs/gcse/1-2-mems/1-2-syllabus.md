# Topic 1.2 - Memory and storage

(21 hours: 28 periods/9 weeks)

1.2.1 Primary storage (Memory)
The need for primary storage
The difference between RAM and ROM
The purpose of ROM in a computer system
The purpose of RAM in a computer system
Virtual memory
Required
Why computers have primary storage
	How this usually consists of RAM and ROM
Key characteristics of RAM and ROM
Why virtual memory may be needed in a system
How virtual memory works
	Transfer of data between RAM and HDD when RAM is filled

1.2.2 Secondary storage
The need for secondary storage
Common types of storage:
­	Optical
­	Magnetic
­	Solid state
Suitable storage devices and storage media for a given application
The advantages and disadvantages of different storage devices and storage media relating to these characteristics:
­	Capacity
­	Speed
­	Portability
­	Durability
­	Reliability
­	Cost
Required
Why computers have secondary storage
Recognise a range of secondary storage devices/media
Differences between each type of storage device/medium
Compare advantages/disadvantages for each storage device
Be able to apply their knowledge in context within scenarios

Not required
	Understanding of the component parts of these types of storage

1.2.3 Units
The units of data storage:
­	Bit
­	Nibble (4 bits)
­	Byte (8 bits)
­	Kilobyte (1,000 bytes or 1 KB)
­	Megabyte (1,000 KB)
­	Gigabyte (1,000 MB)
­	Terabyte (1,000 GB)
­	Petabyte (1,000 TB)
How data needs to be converted into a binary format to be processed by a computer
Data capacity and calculation of data capacity requirements
Required
Why data must be stored in binary format
Familiarity with data units and moving between each
Calculate capacity of devices
Calculate required capacity for a given set of files
Calculate file sizes of sound, images and text files
	sound file size = sample rate x duration (s) x bit depth
	image file size = colour depth x image height (px) x image width (px)
	text file size = bits per character x number of characters

Alternatives
­	Use of 1,024 for conversions and calculations would be acceptable
­	Allowance for metadata in calculations may be used

1.2.4 Data storage
Numbers
How to convert positive denary whole numbers to binary numbers (up to and including 8 bits) and vice versa
How to add two binary integers together (up to and including 8 bits) and explain overflow errors which may occur
How to convert positive denary whole numbers into 2-digit hexadecimal numbers and vice versa
How to convert binary integers to their hexadecimal equivalents and vice versa
Binary shifts
Required
Denary number range 0 – 255
Hexadecimal range 00 – FF
Binary number range 00000000 – 11111111
Understanding of the terms most significant bit, and least significant bit
Conversion of any number in these ranges to another number base
Ability to deal with binary numbers containing between 1 and 8 bits
	e.g. 11010 is the same as 00011010
Understand the effect of a binary shift (both left or right) on a number

Characters
The use of binary codes to represent characters
The term ‘character set’
The relationship between the number of bits per character in a character set, and the number of characters which can be represented, e.g.:
­	ASCII
­	Unicode

Images
How an image is represented as a series of pixels, represented in binary
Metadata
The effect of colour depth and resolution on:
­	The quality of the image
­	The size of an image file

Sound
How sound can be sampled and stored in digital form
The effect of sample rate, duration and bit depth on:
­	The playback quality
­	The size of a sound file
Required
How characters are represented in binary
How the number of characters stored is limited by the bits available
The differences between and impact of each character set
Understand how character sets are logically ordered, e.g. the code for ‘B’ will be one more than the code for ‘A’
Binary representation of ASCII in the exam will use 8 bits
Not required
	Memorisation of character set codes

Required
Each pixel has a specific colour, represented by a specific code
The effect on image size and quality when changing colour depth and resolution
Metadata stores additional image information (e.g. height, width, etc.)

Required
Analogue sounds must be stored in binary
Sample rate – measured in Hertz (Hz)
Duration – how many seconds of audio the sound file contains
Bit depth – number of bits available to store each sample (e.g. 16-bit)

1.2.5 Compression
The need for compression
Types of compression:
­	Lossy
­	Lossless
Required
	Common scenarios where compression may be needed
	Advantages and disadvantages of each type of compression
	Effects on the file for each type of compression

Not required
	Ability to carry out specific compression algorithms
