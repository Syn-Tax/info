# Topic 1.1 - Systems architecture

(9 hours: 12 periods/4 weeks)

1.1.1	Architecture of the CPU
The purpose of the CPU:
­	The fetch-execute cycle
Common CPU components and their function:
­	ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
­	CU (Control Unit)
­	Cache
­	Registers
Von Neumann architecture:
­	MAR (Memory Address Register)
­	MDR (Memory Data Register)
­	Program Counter
­	Accumulator
Required
What actions occur at each stage of the fetch-execute cycle
The role/purpose of each component and what it manages, stores, or controls during the fetch-execute cycle
The purpose of each register, what it stores (data or address)
The difference between storing data and an address

Not required
Knowledge of passing of data between registers in each stage

1.1.2	CPU performance
How common characteristics of CPUs affect their performance:
­	Clock speed
­	Cache size
­	Number of cores
Required
Understanding of each characteristic as listed
The effects of changing any of the common characteristics on system performance, either individually or in combination

1.1.3 Embedded systems
The purpose and characteristics of embedded systems
Examples of embedded systems
Required
What embedded systems are
Typical characteristics of embedded systems
Familiarity with a range of different embedded systems
