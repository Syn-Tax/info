2.1.2 Designing, creating and refining algorithms
Identify the inputs, processes, and outputs for a problem
Structure diagrams
Create, interpret, correct, complete, and refine algorithms using:
­	Pseudocode
­	Flowcharts
­	Reference language/high-level programming language
Identify common errors
Trace tables
Required
Produce simple diagrams to show:
	The structure of a problem
	Subsections and their links to other subsections
Complete, write or refine an algorithm using the techniques listed
Identify syntax/logic errors in code and suggest fixes
Create and use trace tables to follow an algorithm

2.1.3 Searching and sorting algorithms
Standard searching algorithms:
­	Binary search

Identify an algorithm if given the code for it

Not required
	To remember the code for these algorithms

2.2 Programming fundamentals

2.2.1 Programming fundamentals
The use of variables, constants, operators, inputs, outputs and assignments
The use of the three basic programming constructs used to control the flow of a program:
­	Sequence
­	Selection
­	Iteration (count- and condition-controlled loops)
The common arithmetic operators
The common Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT
Required
Practical use of the techniques in a high-level language within the classroom
Understanding of each technique
Recognise and use the following operators:

Comparison operators	Arithmetic operators
==	Equal to	+	Addition
!=	Not equal to	–	Subtraction
<	Less than	*	Multiplication
<=	Less than or equal to	/	Division
>	Greater than	MOD   Modulus
>=	Greater than or equal to	DIV	Quotient
^	Exponentiation (to the power)

2.2.2 Data types
The use of data types:
­	Integer
­	Real
­	Boolean
­	Character and string
­	Casting
Required
Practical use of the data types in a high-level language within the classroom
Ability to choose suitable data types for data in a given scenario
Understand that data types may be temporarily changed through casting, and where this may be useful

2.2.3 Additional programming techniques
The use of basic string manipulation
The use of basic file handling operations:
­	Open
­	Read
­	Write
­	Close
The use of records to store data
The use of SQL to search for data
The use of arrays (or equivalent) when solving problems, including both one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
How to use sub programs (functions and procedures) to produce structured code
Random number generation
Required
Practical use of the additional programming techniques in a high-level language within the classroom
Ability to manipulate strings, including:
	Concatenation
	Slicing
Arrays as fixed length static structures
The use of functions
The use of procedures
Where to use functions and procedures effectively
SQL commands:
	SELECT
	FROM
	WHERE

2.3 Producing robust programs

2.3.1 Defensive design
Defensive design considerations:
­	Anticipating misuse
­	Authentication
Input validation
Maintainability:
­	Use of sub programs
­	Naming conventions
­	Indentation
­	Commenting
Required
Understanding of the issues a programmer should consider to ensure that a program caters for all likely input values
Understanding of how to deal with invalid data in a program
Authentication to confirm the identity of a user
Practical experience of designing input validation and simple authentication (e.g. username and password)
Understand why commenting is useful and apply this appropriately

2.3.2 Testing
The purpose of testing
Types of testing:
­	Iterative
­	Final/terminal
Identify syntax and logic errors
Selecting and using suitable test data:
­	Normal
­	Boundary
­	Invalid
­	Erroneous
Refining algorithms
Required
The difference between testing modules of a program during development and testing the program at the end of production
Syntax errors as errors which break the grammatical rules of the programming language and stop it from being run/translated
Logic errors as errors which produce unexpected output
Normal test data as data which should be accepted by a program without causing errors
Boundary test data as data of the correct type which is on the very edge of being valid
Invalid test data as data of the correct type but outside accepted validation limit
Erroneous test data as data of the incorrect type which should be rejected by a computer system
Ability to identify suitable test data for a given scenario
Ability to create/complete a test plan
