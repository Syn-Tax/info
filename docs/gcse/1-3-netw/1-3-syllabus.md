# Topic 1.3 - Computer networks, connections and protocols

(16 hours: 21 periods/7 weeks)

1.3.1 Networks and topologies
Types of network:
­	LAN (Local Area Network)
­	WAN (Wide Area Network)
Factors that affect the performance of networks
The different roles of computers in a client-server and a peer-to- peer network
The hardware needed to connect stand-alone computers into a Local Area Network:
­	Wireless access points
­	Routers
­	Switches
­	NIC (Network Interface Controller/Card)
­	Transmission media
The Internet as a worldwide collection of computer networks:
­	DNS (Domain Name Server)
­	Hosting
­	The Cloud
­	Web servers and clients
Star and Mesh network topologies
Required
The characteristics of LANs and WANs including common examples of each
Understanding of different factors that can affect the performance of a network, e.g.:
	Number of devices connected
	Bandwidth
The tasks performed by each piece of hardware
The concept of the Internet as a network of computer networks
A DNS’s role in the conversion of a URL to an IP address
Concept of servers providing services (e.g. Web server " Web pages, File server " file storage/retrieval)
Concept of clients requesting/using services from a server
The Cloud: remote service provision (e.g. storage, software, processing)
Advantages and disadvantages of the Cloud
Advantages and disadvantages of the Star and Mesh topologies
Apply understanding of networks to a given scenario

1.3.2 Wired and wireless networks, protocols and layers
Modes of connection:
­	Wired
•	Ethernet
­	Wireless
•	Wi-Fi
•	Bluetooth
Encryption
IP addressing and MAC addressing
Standards
Common protocols including:
­	TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
­	HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
­	HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
­	FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
­	POP (Post Office Protocol)
­	IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
­	SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
The concept of layers
Required
Compare benefits and drawbacks of wired versus wireless connection
Recommend one or more connections for a given scenario
The principle of encryption to secure data across network connections
IP addressing and the format of an IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
A MAC address is assigned to devices; its use within a network
The principle of a standard to provide rules for areas of computing
Standards allows hardware/software to interact across different manufacturers/producers
The principle of a (communication) protocol as a set of rules for transferring data
That different types of protocols are used for different purposes
The basic principles of each protocol i.e. its purpose and key features
How layers are used in protocols, and the benefits of using layers; for a teaching example, please refer to the 4-layer TCP/IP model

Not required
	Understand how Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols work
	Understand differences between static and dynamic, or public and private IP addresses
	Knowledge of individual standards
	Knowledge of the names and function of each TCP/IP layer
