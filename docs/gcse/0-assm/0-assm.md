<dl>
<dt>NEA (old)</dt>
<dd>Programming project</dd>
<dt>Purpose</dt>
<dd>The programming project develops a student's ability to use the knowledge and skills gained through the course to solve a problem. Students will be expected to follow a systematic approach to problem solving, consistent with the skills described in Section 8 of the subject content.
The skills developed can be applied to exam questions on computational thinking.</dd>
<dt>What is produced</dt>
<dd>
• A computer program to solve the programming project<br>
• Written report: totalling 20 hours of timetabled work</dd>
<dt>Tasks</dt>
<dd>The development of a computer program along with the computer programming code itself which has been designed, written and tested by a student to solve a problem. Students will produce an original report outlining this development.</dd>
</dl>

## Assessment objective descriptors
<br>
**Assessment objective:**  
AO1  
**Description:**  
Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key concepts and principles of computer science.  
This will involve recalling definitions and key words, and demonstrating an understanding of what the theory topics are about. You may be asked to define, state, describe, explain etc.  

**Assessment objective:**  
AO2  
**Description:**  
Apply knowledge and understanding of key concepts and principles of computer science.  
This will involve using your knowledge to show your understanding, or applying it to a specific context, e.g. you may be given a scenario and asked to explain how something may be used in it, or why.  

**Assessment objective:**  
AO3  
**Description:**  
Analyse problems in computational terms:  
* to make reasoned judgements; and
* to design, program, evaluate and refine solutions.  
This could involve writing algorithms, pseudo-code and flowcharts. You may be asked to edit a program, evaluate it or improve it. You could also be asked to make a judgement (a decision) about how suitable something is, or is not, for a specific situation.


# Assessment OCR J277 - sitting May 2022

## Forms of assessment

OCR’s GCSE (9–1) in Computer Science consists of two compulsory components that are externally assessed.

### J277/01: Computer systems

This component is an externally assessed written examination testing AO1 and AO2.  

Worth 80 marks, representing 50% of the total marks for the GCSE (9–1).  

Examination lasts 1 hour 30 minutes.  

All the questions are mandatory.  

Non-calculator examination.  

The question paper consist of short and medium answer questions. There will also be one 8-mark extended response question. This question will enable students to demonstrate the ability to construct and develop a sustained line of reasoning.  

### J277/02: Computational thinking, algorithms and programming

This component is an externally assessed written examination testing AO1, AO2 and AO3.  

Worth 80 marks, representing 50% of the total marks for the GCSE (9–1).  

Examination lasts 1 hour 30 minutes and is formed of two sections.  

All the questions are mandatory.  

Section A - worth 50 marks - assesses students’ knowledge and understanding of concepts of Computer Science. Students then apply these to problems in computational terms, where they may use an algorithmic approach.  

Section B - worth 30 marks - assesses students’ Practical Programming skills and their ability to design, write, test and refine programs.

Non-calculator examination.  

The question paper will consist of short and medium answer questions.

## Assessment Objectives

There are three Assessment Objectives (AOs) in OCR GCSE (9–1) in Computer Science. These are detailed in the table below. Students are expected to:

<dl>
<dt>AO1</dt>
<dd>Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key concepts and principles of Computer Science.</dd>
<dt>AO2</dt>
<dd>Apply knowledge and understanding of key concepts and principles of Computer Science.</dd>
<dt>AO3</dt>
<dd>Analyse problems in computational terms:<br>
• to make reasoned judgements<br>
• to design, program, evaluate and refine solutions.</dd>
</dl>

Assessment Objective weightings in OCR GCSE (9–1) in Computer Science
The relationship between the Assessment Objectives and the components are shown in the following table:

| Component        | AO1  | AO2 | AO3 |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|:------|
| Computer systems (J277/01) | 21 | 29  | 0  |
| Computational thinking, algorithms and programming (J277/02) | 9 | 11  | 30  |
| Total (%) | 30% | 40%  | 30%  |

## Practical Programming skills

All students must be given the opportunity to undertake a programming task or tasks during their course of study.

The programming task(s) must allow them to develop skills within the following areas when programming:
*   Design
*   Write
*   Test
*   Refine

Each task(s) must use one or more high-level text-based programming language, either to a specification or to solve a problem (or problems). They can use any high-level text-based programming language, such as:
*   Python
*   C family of languages (C#, C++, etc.)
*   Java
*   JavaScript
*   Visual Basic/.Net
*   PHP
*   Delphi
*   BASIC

Some high-level languages do not allow demonstration of all the Practical Programming skills. Where this is the case, schools are encouraged to consider using a second language for practical experience.

Practical Programming skills will be assessed in Component 2 of the qualification, in particular Section B. See Section 3b ‘Assessment of Practical Programming skills: Component 2’ for more details.
